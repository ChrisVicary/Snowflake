# Snowflake
A C# game engine based on the [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) engine by [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject). The creation of this engine closely follows the [Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) of tutorials on how to make a game engine in C++. During the series TheCherno describes all the steps has taken in creating his Hazel engine. Along the way I have adapted the code and structure to match how I like to work in C#.
