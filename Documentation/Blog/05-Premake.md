# Premake

## Should I Use Premake

At first when I saw that TheCherno's series was going to use Premake as a build system to generate the project files and solution I didn't think that it would be as useful for me as I would be using C#. However the more I thought about it I decided it might still be useful. If I'm adding projects, not having to copy the output folders everytime and in the future I might be adding some C++/CLI projects to interface with OpenGL. 
I spent a little bit of time playing around with a few options, but I was struggling to get some of the newer C# features working without adding a bunch of extra configuration options. I have to leave this for now, but I may well re-visit this decision if I do start to use C++/CLI in the future.
