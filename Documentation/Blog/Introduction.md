# Introduction

I've wanted to go through the process of writing a game engine for a long time. But it's often been one of those things that I don't know where to start. I then came across a YouTube series by TheCherno in which he details a lot of the steps he took to create a game engine called Hazel. As I watched the first few episodes I became inspired to take a similar journey however I wanted to work in the language that I am most familiar with, C#.

This repository is my attempt at following the series from TheCherno and adapting his code for C#. There might be times when I do something quite differently which is why I wanted to document the process in this blog and provide some rational for my decisions.
